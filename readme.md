<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## <span style="color:red"> Project Description* </span>

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->



I put this together to show what a detailed README is like. This README is written and styled in Markdown.  You can edit this eitehr in the browser or your code editor. VScode does have a Markdown extension which will show you the syntax highlighting.

Why doing this detailed README is important:
* Recruiters who looks at your project might not know how to reade code.
* You an reuse it over and over again. Save time and work on your projects more by just editing this to match your next project!
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:


Here's a blank template to get started:
**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`
